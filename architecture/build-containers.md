# Container Images

OpenShell produces two container images, both published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Gateway (`openshell/gateway`)

The gateway runs the control plane API server. It is deployed as a StatefulSet inside the cluster container via a bundled Helm chart.

- **Build target**: `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` target `gateway`
- **Registry**: `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/gateway:latest`
- **Pulled when**: Cluster startup (the Helm chart triggers the pull)
- **Entrypoint**: `openshell-server --port 8080` (gRPC + HTTP, mTLS)

## Cluster (`openshell/cluster`)

The cluster image is a single-container Kubernetes distribution that bundles the Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, and the `openshell-sandbox` supervisor binary needed to bootstrap the control plane.

- **Build target**: `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` target `cluster`
- **Registry**: `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/cluster:latest`
- **Pulled when**: `openshell gateway start`

The supervisor binary (`openshell-sandbox`) is cross-compiled in a build stage and placed at `/opt/openshell/bin/openshell-sandbox`. It is exposed to sandbox pods at runtime via a read-only `hostPath` volume mount — it is not baked into sandbox images.

## Controlled GPU Runtime Bundle Path

OpenShell's runtime bundle publication contract is tarball-first. The canonical artifact is a per-architecture release tarball whose single top-level bundle directory contains the install-root payload plus `manifest.json`. If OCI publication is added later, it is only a mirror transport for that same bundle contract.

The current cluster build now consumes that published tarball through the local staged bundle path. `tasks/scripts/docker-build-image.sh cluster` requires `OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_TARBALL`, fails before any Helm packaging or Docker build when the bundle is missing or invalid, and stages the verified install-root payload under `deploy/docker/.build/runtime-bundle/<arch>/`. `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` target `cluster` then copies the runtime binaries, config, and shared libraries from that staged local tree into the final cluster image.

That requirement now flows through all cluster-image entrypoints instead of only the direct script call:

- local bootstrap via `tasks/scripts/cluster-bootstrap.sh` requires `OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_TARBALL` whenever it is going to build the cluster image; prebuilt-image flows can still set `SKIP_CLUSTER_IMAGE_BUILD=1`
- remote gateway deploy via `scripts/remote-deploy.sh` requires either `--runtime-bundle-tarball` (or local `OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_TARBALL`) for sync-and-build flows, or `--remote-runtime-bundle-tarball` when `--skip-sync` should reuse a tarball already staged on the remote host; the script exports the resolved remote path before invoking the remote cluster build
- multi-arch publishing via `tasks/scripts/docker-publish-multiarch.sh` requires `OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_TARBALL_AMD64` and `OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_TARBALL_ARM64`, builds one verified per-arch cluster image at a time, then assembles the final multi-arch manifest from those architecture-specific tags
- GitHub workflow cluster builds now consume release-asset URLs rather than local tarball paths directly: `tasks/scripts/download-runtime-bundle.sh` downloads per-arch tarballs into `deploy/docker/.build/runtime-bundles/`, `tasks/scripts/ci-build-cluster-image.sh` maps single-arch builds to `docker:build:cluster` and multi-arch builds to `docker:build:cluster:multiarch`, and `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` passes explicit bundle URLs from workflow inputs or repo variables into that helper path

The intended first OpenShell tarball consumption path is the `tasks/scripts/docker-build-image.sh cluster` -> `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` target `cluster` flow:

1. `tasks/scripts/docker-build-image.sh cluster` receives the per-architecture runtime bundle tarball path through `OPENSHELL_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_TARBALL` before `docker buildx build`.
2. The script verifies the single top-level bundle-directory shape, requires valid JSON `manifest.json` content inside that bundle directory with a matching `architecture`, validates manifest-declared checksums and sizes, and checks the required runtime payload paths before staging.
3. The script stages the tarball payload into `deploy/docker/.build/runtime-bundle/<arch>/`, preserving the bundle directory and install-root layout expected by OpenShell.
4. `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images` target `cluster` loads the staged local bundle tree in the `runtime-bundle` stage and copies the verified runtime files into the same final image paths OpenShell already expects.

The tarball payload must contain the exact runtime assets the cluster image expects today:

- `/usr/bin/nvidia-cdi-hook`
- `/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime`
- `/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime-hook`
- `/usr/bin/nvidia-container-cli`
- `/usr/bin/nvidia-ctk`
- `/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/`
- `/usr/lib/*-linux-gnu/libnvidia-container*.so*`

This handoff keeps the OpenShell build package-manager-free for the runtime dependency itself. Standard OS image layers can remain upstream inputs, but the GPU runtime contents enter the build as a verified tarball payload rather than through a distro package repository. OCI, if later added, mirrors this same tarball-defined payload instead of changing the OpenShell consumption contract.

## Sandbox Images

Sandbox images are **not built in this repository**. They are maintained in the [openshell-community](https://github.com/nvidia/openshell-community) repository and pulled from `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/` at runtime.

The default sandbox image is `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/base:latest`. To use a named community sandbox:

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from <name>
```

This pulls `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/<name>:latest`.

## Local Development

`mise run cluster` is the primary development command. It bootstraps a cluster if one doesn't exist, then performs incremental deploys for subsequent runs.

The incremental deploy (`cluster-deploy-fast.sh`) fingerprints local Git changes and only rebuilds components whose files have changed:

| Changed files | Rebuild triggered |
|---|---|
| Cargo manifests, proto definitions, cross-build script | Gateway + supervisor |
| `crates/openshell-server/*`, `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.gateway` | Gateway |
| `crates/openshell-sandbox/*`, `crates/openshell-policy/*` | Supervisor |
| `deploy/helm/openshell/*` | Helm upgrade |

When no local changes are detected, the command is a no-op.

**Gateway updates** are pushed to a local registry and the StatefulSet is restarted. **Supervisor updates** are copied directly into the running cluster container via `docker cp` — new sandbox pods pick up the updated binary immediately through the hostPath mount, with no image rebuild or cluster restart required.

Fingerprints are stored in `.cache/cluster-deploy-fast.state`. You can also target specific components explicitly:

```bash
mise run cluster -- gateway    # rebuild gateway only
mise run cluster -- supervisor # rebuild supervisor only
mise run cluster -- chart      # helm upgrade only
mise run cluster -- all        # rebuild everything
```
